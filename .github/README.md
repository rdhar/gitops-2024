## Workflow

- Create feature branch off main
- Commit change locally and push to remote
- Create a draft pull request that targets the main branch: `gh pr create --draft --base main`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pull Request must be set to draft to prevent CODEOWNER reviewers being assigned until the pull request is ready.
> This cannot be set by default. See [open discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/6943)
> Unfortunately this also cannot be automated because action runners, using `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication, are unable to run `gh pr ready --undo` as the integration is unavailable. See [open discussion](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/8910)

- When the [Workflows](#workflows) have completed, mark the PR as ready to assign a reviewer from CODEOWNERS. (again cannot be automated on a runner)
- If the PR is approved, merge the pull request. The branch will be automatically deleted.

### Workflows

#### Infracost

[Infracost](workflows/infracost.yaml) runs on pull requests when they are opened or synchronized. The workflow generates a cost difference of the resources between the main branch and the proposed changes on the feature branch. The pull request is updated with this information. <!--> # TODO: Add example here

This workflow also flags any policy violations defined in [infracost-policy.rego](../infracost/infracost-policy.rego). See an example in this [pull_request](https://github.com/3ware/gitops-2024/pull/6)

#### Terraform CI
